<p> Hello my name and Bruno Ramalho Furlan and I'm fascinated by technology. 
I consider myself typical STEM (Science, Technology, Engineeering and Mathemathics) professional due to my training and interests. 
In recent years I have been working with information technology and engineering and developing projects in these areas.</p> 
<p>For now, I'm interested in developing several types of projects, especially those dealing with automation processes 
and those dealing with processing, interpreting, generating and manipulating data. 
I'm currently working on several projects, which use python, R and SQL languages, and with websites development also, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
